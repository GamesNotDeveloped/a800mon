# Atari800 Remote Monitor Binary Protocol (RPC)

This document describes the Remote Monitor binary RPC protocol implemented in `src/remotemonitor.c`.

## Transport

- Transport: UNIX domain stream socket (`AF_UNIX`, `SOCK_STREAM`)
- Enable in emulator:
  - `-remote-monitor`
  - `-remote-monitor-transport socket`
  - `-remote-monitor-socket-path <path>` (optional; on Linux default is `/tmp/atari.sock`)
  - config: `REMOTE_MONITOR_TRANSPORT=socket`, `REMOTE_MONITOR_SOCKET_PATH=<path>`
- Multiple clients supported: up to 8
- Model: request/response (no unsolicited server messages)

## Endianness

All multi-byte integers are little-endian.

## Frame Format

### Request Frame (client -> server)

| Field | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cmd` | `u8` | Command identifier. |
| `payload_len` | `u16` | Number of bytes in `payload`. |
| `payload` | `payload_len` | Command-specific bytes. |

### Response Frame (server -> client)

| Field | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `u8` | `0` on success, non-zero on error. |
| `data_len` | `u16` | Number of bytes in `data`. |
| `data` | `data_len` | Command-specific success data or error text. |

## Limits and Behavior

- Max payload/data bytes: `4096` (`REMOTE_MONITOR_MAX_PAYLOAD`)
- If declared frame size exceeds internal input buffer, server closes client connection
- Queued `STATUS` requests are coalesced: only newest pending `STATUS` is handled
- Server send path is non-blocking; send failure closes client connection

## `state_seq` Semantics

`state_seq` is a monotonic `u32` included in `STATUS`.

It increments when emulator state is changed by Remote Monitor commands and builtin monitor operations (for example memory writes, media changes, resets). Clients can poll `STATUS` and refresh when `state_seq` changes.

## Python Examples

### `READ_MEM`

```python
payload = struct.pack("<HH", addr, count)
status, data = rpc.call(Command.READ_MEM, payload)
```

### `WRITE_MEMORY`

```python
buf = bytes([0xA9, 0x00, 0x8D, 0x00, 0xD0])
payload = struct.pack("<HH", addr, len(buf)) + buf
status, data = rpc.call(Command.WRITE_MEMORY, payload)
```

### `STATUS`

```python
flags, emu_ms, reset_ms, state_seq, machine_type = struct.unpack("<BQQIB", data)
paused = bool(flags & 0x01)
crashed = bool(flags & 0x80)
```

### `BUILD_FEATURES`

```python
status, data = rpc.call(Command.BUILD_FEATURES, b"")
count = struct.unpack_from("<H", data, 0)[0]
caps = [struct.unpack_from("<H", data, 2 + i * 2)[0] for i in range(count)]
```
